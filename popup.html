    <p>The Markup built APPNAME to reveal which products are Amazon brands and exclusives in search results.
        <br><br>
        Amazon trademarked hundreds of private label brands and stocks even more Amazon-exclusive products on their platform.
        Almost <span class="selection" >40 percent</span> of Amazon brands and exclusives in popular searches were <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results#how-often-are-products-from-amazon-brands-and-exclusives-labeled">not disclosed</a> to shoppers,

        Amazon gives itself an <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products">unfair advantage</a> in ranking, placing its own brands and exclusive products in the top search result before better-rated competitors.

  <h2 class="accordion">Identification Methods</h2>
  <div class="accordion-panel ">
    <div class="identification xtra">
    <p>This extension looks for several clues to identify products as Amazon.<br><br>
                <div class="heading">"Featured from our brands"</div>
                Labelled "Featured from Our Brands." Source code suggests these products are ads, but Amazon says they are neither an ad nor a search result, but rather "merchandising placement."<br><br>
                <div class="heading">Carousel</div>
                Identified in a carousel devoted to Amazon's brands and exclusives. Carousels are present in about three in four of the popular search pages we analyzed.<br><br>
                <div class="heading">“Our brands” Filter</div>
                Amazon describes "our brands" as "a collection of Amazon private brands and a curated selection of brands sold exclusively on Amazon." We access the filter in the background using an API call. <br><br>
                <div class="heading">Proprietary Electronics</div>
                Identified from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Amazon-Devices-Accessories/zgbs/amazon-devices/ref=zg_bs_nav_0">Amazon Best-Sellers</a> list for "Amazon Devices & Accessories," or added manually. Made up of electronics like Ring doorbells, Fire TVs, and Kindles.<br><br>
                <div class="heading">Known Brands and Other Disclaimers</div>
                Brand names like “AmazonBasics” and disclaimers like “Amazon brand.” See the dislaimers and brands we used on GitHub.</p>
