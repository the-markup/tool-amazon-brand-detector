    <p>The Markup built Brand Buster to reveal which products are Amazon brands and exclusives in search results.
        <br><br>
        Amazon has hundreds of private labels and even more Amazon-exclusive products on their platform.
        In a national survey, most Americans were unable to identify best-selling Amazon brands like Solimo or Goodthreads. 
        Further, Amazon regularly placed its own products infront of competitors despite having worse star ratings and less reviews.

  <h2 class="accordion">Identification Methods</h2>
  <div class="accordion-panel ">
    <div class="identification xtra">
    <p>Almost <span class="selection">40 percent</span> of Amazon brands and exclusive products were unlabeled in popular searches. This extension uses several clues to identify products as Amazon.<br>
                <div class="heading">"Featured from our brands"</div>
                Labelled "Featured from Our Brands." Source code suggests these products are ads, but Amazon says they are neither an ad nor a search result, but rather "merchandising placement."<br><br>
                <div class="heading">Carousel</div>
                Identified in a carousel devoted to Amazon's brands and exclusives. Carousels are present in about three in four of the popular search pages we analyzed.<br><br>
                <div class="heading">“Our brands” Filter</div>
                Listed in the "Our Brands" filter, which we accessed in the background of the search page using an API call. Amazon describes "our brands" as "a collection of Amazon private brands and a curated selection of brands sold exclusively on Amazon."<br><br>
                <div class="heading">Proprietary Electronics</div>
                Identified from the Amazon Best-Seller list for "Amazon Devices & Accessories," or added manually. This is made up of electronics like Ring doorbells, Fire TVs, and Kindles.<br><br>
                <div class="heading">Known Brands and Other Disclaimers</div>
                Brand names like “AmazonBasics” and disclaimers like “Amazon brand.” See the dislaimers and brands we used on GitHub.</p>
