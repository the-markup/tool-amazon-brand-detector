        The Markup built this extension to identify Amazon brands and exclusives while you shop online.
        <br><br>
        Amazon has registered trademarks for more than 150 private-label brands and sells hundreds of thousands of products under those names, most of which are not obviously affiliated with Amazon. We found that Amazon did not disclose its ownership for almost <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results#how-often-are-products-from-amazon-brands-and-exclusives-labeled">40 percent</a> of Amazon brands and exclusive items in popular searches, 
        and <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results#amazon-methodology-fig4a-survey-bars-Q1">few Americans can identify even top-selling Amazon brands</a> as owned by Amazon.
        We also found Amazon gives itself a <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products">leg up</a> in search, placing products from its own brands and exclusives ahead of better-rated competitors.

        This extension looks for several clues to <span class="selection">highlight</span> products as Amazon.<br><br>
        <div class="heading">"Featured from our brands"</div>
        Amazon labels some items "Featured from our brands." The items were tagged “Sponsored” in the source code but not publicly. Amazon says these are neither ads nor search results, but rather "merchandising placement."<br><br>
        <div class="heading">Carousel</div>
        In about three in four popular search pages, Amazon added special sections to of the search results page devoted to Amazon's brands and exclusives. We call these carousels.<br><br>
        <div class="heading">“Our Brands” Filter</div>
        Amazon describes "Our Brands" as "a collection of Amazon private brands and a curated selection of brands sold exclusively on Amazon." We access the filter in the background using an API call. <br><br>
        <div class="heading">Proprietary Electronics</div>
        Identified from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Amazon-Devices-Accessories/zgbs/amazon-devices/ref=zg_bs_nav_0">Amazon Best Sellers</a> list for "Amazon Devices & Accessories," or added manually. Includes Ring doorbells, Fire TVs, and Kindles.<br><br>
        <div class="heading">Known Brands and Other Disclaimers</div>
        We look for obvious brand names like “AmazonBasics” and/or a disclosure in the title or listing that it’s an “Amazon Brand.”  See more on <a href="https://github.com/the-markup/tool-amazon-brand-detector">GitHub</a>.
