        The Markup built this extension to reveal Amazon brands and exclusives while you shop online.
        <br><br>
        Amazon has trademarked over 150 private-label brands and sells hundreds of thousands of products from these brands.
        Almost <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results#how-often-are-products-from-amazon-brands-and-exclusives-labeled">40 percent</a> of Amazon brands and exclusives in popular searches were not disclosed to shoppers, 
        and <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results#amazon-methodology-fig4a-survey-bars-Q1">few Americans can identify top-selling Amazon brands</a>.
        Amazon gives itself an <a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products">unfair advantage</a> in search, placing its own brands ahead of better-rated competitors.

        This extension looks for several clues to <span class="selection">highlight</span> products as Amazon.<br><br>
        <div class="heading">"Featured from our brands"</div>
        Labelled "Featured from Our Brands." Source code suggests these products are ads, but Amazon says they are neither an ad nor a search result, but rather "merchandising placement."<br><br>
        <div class="heading">Carousel</div>
        Identified in a carousel devoted to Amazon's brands and exclusives. Carousels are present in about three in four of the popular search pages we analyzed.<br><br>
        <div class="heading">“Our brands” Filter</div>
        Amazon describes "our brands" as "a collection of Amazon private brands and a curated selection of brands sold exclusively on Amazon." We access the filter in the background using an API call. <br><br>
        <div class="heading">Proprietary Electronics</div>
        Identified from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Amazon-Devices-Accessories/zgbs/amazon-devices/ref=zg_bs_nav_0">Amazon Best-Sellers</a> list for "Amazon Devices & Accessories," or added manually. Made up of electronics like Ring doorbells, Fire TVs, and Kindles.<br><br>
        <div class="heading">Known Brands and Other Disclaimers</div>
        Brand names like “AmazonBasics” and disclaimers like “Amazon brand.” See the dislaimers and brands we used on GitHub.
